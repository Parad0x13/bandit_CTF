This one is done a bit different than the rest
We are provided with a private ssh key which we can use as the identity_file
ssh -i sshkey_private bandit14@localhost

This will log us directly into bandit14 and we can find the flag at /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
This file is only readable by bandit14 so we must be bandit14 first to read it
