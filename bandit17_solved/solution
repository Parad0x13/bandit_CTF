I had to chmod 600 id_rsa to coerce ssh into using the key. By default just writing the key to a file grants it too many permissions to outside users. This is an interesting security feature
I also had to login a different way by passing the id_rsa private key through ssh

Finding the only changed line between the two files here was super easy

The flag was the first line
